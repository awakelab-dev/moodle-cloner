# Changelog

All notable changes to the Moodle Cloner web app are tracked here.
Every code iteration must bump the version in `VERSION` and add an entry below.

Format: `YYYY-MM-DD - vX.Y.Z - Short description` followed by a bulleted list.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-26

Diagnostics groundwork to unblock clone-failure debugging.

- Added `VERSION` file and this `CHANGELOG.md` as the iteration tracker; version is now surfaced in `app.py` and rendered in the web UI header.
- Fixed cleanup trap in `moodle-clone-web.sh` to use `sudo rm -rf` for `$TMP_DIR`. Files in `$TMP_DIR/source_data/` are written by `sudo rsync --rsync-path="sudo rsync"` and end up root-owned on the cloner host, so plain `rm -rf` was producing hundreds of "Permission denied" lines that filled the in-memory log ring buffer (250K chars) and masked the real upstream error. Note: this only touches `/tmp/tmp.XXXX` on the cloner box; no change to the source instance.
- Persisted full job output to disk under `./logs/job-<id>.log` in `app.py`. The web UI still shows the truncated tail, but the on-disk file is complete so we can see what actually failed before the cleanup spam.
- Surfaced effective `rc` and fatal-marker detection unchanged; this iteration is diagnostic only and does not attempt to fix the underlying deployment bug.
